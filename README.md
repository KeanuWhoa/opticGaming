<h1> OpTic Gaming Side Project </h1>

<p>Decided to re-do ("refresh") the current OpTic website and make improvements across the board. The goal was improve the overall CSS, while creating more robust Team and News pages. </p>
<p>This was also one of my first attempts with AngularJS, and used this project as a way to understand some of its features</p>
